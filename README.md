# build for production
npm run build

# preview production build locally
npm run preview
```

## Project structure

- src/

  - App.jsx — main app
  - main.jsx — app entry
  - index.css — Tailwind + global styles
  - components/
    - Navbar.jsx
    - Hero.jsx
    - Features.jsx

## Features

- Vite-powered React app for fast dev builds
- Tailwind CSS utility-first styling
- Lucide icons used across components
- Responsive layout with accessible markup

## Common tasks

- Replace placeholder assets (logo.png) in /public or import into components.
- Edit site text inside component files under src/components.
- Add or update Tailwind config in tailwind.config.js (if present).

## Deployment

Deploy to Vercel, Netlify, or any static host that supports a built SPA. Typical settings:

- Build command: npm run build
- Publish directory: dist

## Notes & tips

- Use absolute paths (e.g., `/images/...`) for public assets with Vite.
- Ensure accessibility attributes (aria-label, alt text) are set for icons and images.
- Fix any sample typos in src/data/CodeExample.js before publishing.
